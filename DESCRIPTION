Description: package relax contains some functions for report
    writing, presentation, and programming: relax(), tangleR(),
    weaveR(), (g)slider(). "relax" is written in R and Tcl/Tk.
    relax creates a new window (top level Tcl/Tk widget) that consists
    of two text fields and some buttons and menus.
    Text (chunks) and code (chunks) are inserted in the upper text field (report field).
    Code chunks are evaluated by clicking on EvalRCode.
    Results are shown in the lower text field (output field) and
    will be transferred to the report field by pressing on Insert.
    In this way you get correct reports. These reports can be
    loaded again in cause of presentation, modification and result checking.
    tangleR() and weaveR() implement a plain kind of tangling
    and weaving. gslider() and slider() are designed to define sliders for interactive
    experiments in a simple way.
    The syntax rules of code chunks and text chunks are defined by 
    the noweb system proposed by Norman Ramsey
    (http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/intro.html).
